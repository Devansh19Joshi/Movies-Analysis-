The genres with the lowest average score are Western, Thriller and Horror.\n\n\nMovies that are released in the summers are more likely to have high gross earnings than movies that are released in the winters. This could be due to a number of factors, including the fact that people are more likely to go to the movies during the summer, summer movies are often marketed towards families and children, and summer movies are often blockbusters.\n\n\nOverall, the analysis suggests that a number of factors can influence the success of a movie, including its budget, rating, genre, and release date. However, it is important to note that there are always exceptions to the rule, and that there are many great movies in all genres and with all budgets.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Discussion**\n\nThe results of our analysis raise a number of interesting questions.For example : why is the average budget of movies increasing over time? Is this a good thing or a bad thing? How does the increasing budget of movies affect the quality of movies? Additionally, why are certain genres of movies more popular than others? Does this have to do with the quality of the movies, or with other factors, such as marketing and distribution?\n\nThese are just a few of the questions that could be explored further. Additional research could be done to investigate these questions in more depth, and to identify other factors that may influence the success of a movie.","metadata":{}}]}
